        <h1>Bakery pizza</h1>
        <img src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F3474658.jpg&w=596&h=399&c=sc&poi=face&q=85">
        <p>Now found exclusively at one well-known pizza garden in Gravesend, Brooklyn, this style of pizza was once found in neighborhood bakeries.
             This pizza is deceivingly light, crisp, and slightly spicy. Enjoy with a can of soda.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¼ cups warm water
                
                
                
                </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li> 3 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons fine salt</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>>
             <li>1 (28 ounce) can plain crushed tomatoes</li>

        <h2>Steps of recipes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Pour in yeast mixture. Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes.</li>> 
            <li>Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil. Form dough into a tight ball and lightly grease the top. Place in the bowl; 
                cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes..</li>     
             <li>Mix crushed tomatoes and pizza sauce together in a bowl to make sauce.</li>    
             <li>Grease a heavy-gauge rimmed 12x17-inch baking sheet generously with olive oil. Press dough into the bottom. Prick dough all over with a fork.
                  Arrange mozzarella cheese slices over dough; cover with 1 cup sauce. Sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese on top. Drizzle remaining olive oil over pizza.</li>
             <li>Let pizza rise in a warm area until puffy, about 1 hour</li>   
             <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>  
             <li>Bake pizza on the center rack of 
                 the preheated oven until edges are very dark brown but top is not burnt, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before slicing into squares.</li>
        </ol>
